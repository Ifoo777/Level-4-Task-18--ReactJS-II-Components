# Level-4-Task-18--ReactJS-II-Components

## Task 1

Use React to create a website for a fictitious clothing brand.

● Create a header component that displays a logo (see here for help) and company name. It should be able to welcome a user to the site or ask them to sign in, depending on boolean input.

● Create a landing page component that tells the user about the company.

● Create a product component that displays information about the products that the company sells.

● Edit your existing App.js file so that it displays the header component, the landing page component and at least three product components. Use an array of values and props to do this. Pass props to the header component to specify whether the user is logged in or not.

● Make sure that your application is attractively styled. Use any custom CSS and/or CSS libraries of your choice in this regard.

## Task 2

Use React to create an abridged online CV for yourself.

For an example of what an online CV typically looks like, have a look at this example(https://jonbloomer.com.au/).

Custom-styled CV’s for developers are very common, and make a great impression in recruiters.
